== Content Type

lab

== Red Hat Products Covered

* Red Hat OpenShift
* Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization
* Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation
* Migration Toolkit for Virtualization

== Intended Audience

* Virtual Machine Administrators responsible for the day-to-day management of virtual guests, including provisioning and resource management.
* Virtual Infrastructure Administrators responsible for the physical infrastructure hosting the OpenShift Virtualization solution, including hardware, storage, and networking.
* Cloud Administrators looking to integrate virtual machines into a Kubernetes-based infrastructure and manage them using Kubernetes-native tools.
* DevOps Engineers seeking to modernize existing applications by combining virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions in a unified environment.

== Lab Highlights

* Create and manage virtual machines within the OpenShift Virtualization environment using templates and the virtualization perspective.
* Migrate existing virtual machines from VMware vSphere to OpenShift Virtualization using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV).
* Manage storage for virtual machines, including examining persistent volume claims (PVCs), creating snapshots, and cloning VMs.
* Implement backup and recovery strategies for virtual machines using OpenShift APIs for Data Protection (OADP).
* Expose applications running on virtual machines using OpenShift services and routes for external access.
* Connect virtual machines directly to physical networks using network attachment definitions (NADs) and user defined networks (UDNs).
