= Migration plan issues

== Issue: When I created a Migration Plan (Plans for Virtualization), it threw this error: "The plan is not ready - VDDKInvalid VDDK init image is invalid. To troubleshoot, check the Forklift controller pod logs."

I checked the Forklift controller pod logs but not sure what I am supposed to look for.

I scaled the pod to zero on Forklift controller Deployment and re-scaled it back to recreate the pod but it did not resolve the issue.

=== Solution

This is perhaps a problem only on the Partner portal.
